I have been trying to figure out what exactly is my purpose in life. What are the things that can be attained in this world that would make me feel fulfilled? 

So a bit of story about myself, I never really had a 'passion' not until I started programming. Which is about 3/4 years ago when I wrote my first code back in college. For the first time in my life, I finally have something that I genuinely love doing. I wouldn't feel burned out or tired at all. I just loved doing it purely for the sake of the excitement I get out of it. And it was never due to external sources.  

This past year and a half has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me. Everything seemed to happen so quickly. And in that relatively short span of time, I have experienced both joy, and dissapointment on all sort of levels. Leaving me unable to fully process and contemplate on those emotions. 

A lot of things didn't quite work out as I had anticipated. I recently learned over the past months, that being overly attached to some expectations will only leave you feeling devastated if they don't come into fruition. And even if they do, the outcomes no longer come out as surprising when you already set some expectations on the desired result. You wouldn't feel as happy or sad compare to when you're not hoping for that particular outcome in the first place. Same as when you don't set any expectations at all.

Nevertheless, I'm grateful for the good things that happened unexpectedly. Those are the ones that I cherish the most. For those are the ones that makes me feel blessed in this world.
