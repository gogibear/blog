Before I left for a three day trip.<br>

I went to say goodbye to my sweetheart.<br>

As I leaned down,<br>
she planted several big wet kisses on my lips.<br>
And I smiled.<br>

It was much earlier than she scheduled her breakfasts.<br>
So she lay there as I left.<br>

Aboout to close the door,<br>
I looked back and she was licking the floor just as passionately.<br>

But her tail was wagging in my direction so I think it still counts.<br>
