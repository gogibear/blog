Who was I? What was I like before? Was this always on my mind? The memories of my past self has become blurry.

As I continued, I slowly forgot how I was 2 years before. My devotion was justified by what I believed to be _right_. The reasoning was faithful to my own definition of *it*, but I may have devoted myself to the wrong thing.

Next time, I should have chosen my devotions more carefully.
