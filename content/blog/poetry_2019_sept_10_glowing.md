Keep making what you think are mistakes.<br>

The moon watches you stumble and fall,<br>
like a proud father seeing his child take their first steps,<br>

because she knows you were born to run.<br>

And I bet you didn't realize,<br>

it's you she cradles in her arms,<br>

on those nights she looks full.<br>
