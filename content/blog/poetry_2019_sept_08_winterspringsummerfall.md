Good poetry will take a peach,<br>

and tell you it's a globe covered in soft tendrils,<br>
that glows with the power of the sun<br>
and the sweetness of a million kisses.<br>

So that you're left saying: Wow! What is that?<br>

Great poetry has a big mouth,<br>
and can't keep any secrets,<br>

and will quickly let you know, straight up,<br>

It's sugar, orange and yellow saying,<br>

"I love you."<br>

I've taken it one step further,<br>

when I get a peach,<br>

I eat it.<br>
