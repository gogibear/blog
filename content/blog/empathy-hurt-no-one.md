Your friend looks troubled. Instead making fun of them or even just ignoring them, it doesn’t hurt to be a bit empathetic and ask them if they’re all right.

You work on a medium size code base with several other engineers in the team. Instead of writing code only you can understand, take into account how your colleagues would interact with your code. Something that I always try to be conscious about when coding is, if I were to disappear tomorrow, how much time and effort would my colleagues need to spend to understand my code. Put meaningful comments, write obvious code. It really doesn’t hurt to be a bit empathetic and write code in a collaborative manner.

You’re in a relationship with someone that you love. You enjoy spending time together. If you truly love your partner, does it hurt for you to be empathetic towards them and to understand how they’d feel if you say or do those bad things to them? Loving someone means that the only thing that’s going to be painful for you is to realise not being empathetic is the reason why the relationship fall apart.

If anything, you should realise that being empathetic would only benefit you rather than hurting you. Be more empathetic.
