To me, the biggest regret is knowing that I didn't try hard enough when I know I should have. It's easier to let go of attachments once you've realized there's nothing else you could do that can change the outcome.

At that moment, you understand that whatever the outcome is, it's meant to be.

I'm learning to not get too attached on things I have no control over. Sometimes it's better to just flow with what the world has already destined for you.
