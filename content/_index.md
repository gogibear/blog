I have some things I've been meaning to share with you.

<div class="section">
<div class="section-title">Dear Theo</div>

*One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul and yet no one ever comes to sit by it. Passers-by see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney, and continue on their way.*

`Vincent van Gogh`

<div class="section">
<div class="section-title">A Love Like That</div>

*Now I keep filling up my cup,*<br>
*until it spills over.*<br>

*Before,*<br>
*I kept buying bigger cups.*<br>

*It's made all the difference.*<br>

</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="section-title">Masque Off</div>

*Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud<br>
Turn forth her silver lining on the night?<br>
I did not err; there does a sable cloud<br>
Turn forth her silver lining on the night,<br>
And casts a gleam over this tufted grove.<br>*

`John Milton`
