I have some things I've been meaning to share with you.

My dear `Theo,`

I am writing to you again rather soon, and perhaps it is not so very necessary to do so, but I want to tell you just a few things. I am trying now to get some more insight into the miners' work; I have spoken to some of them in the past few days, and it strikes me again how different they are from what one might think them to be. Certainly they are rough and unpolished on the outside, but at the same time one finds in them a certain delicacy and a peculiar inward devotion to their work that touches me.

I also feel more and more that painting will be for me something like the way to a church. I mean, it will bring me closer to something higher and purer.

*One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul and yet no one ever comes to sit by it. Passers-by see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney, and continue on their way.* Now, look here, what is to be done? Must one consider that everything is lost?

You see, that is not true. And one must deliberately work to preserve the small flame of one's soul, to protect it from being extinguished. One must not let oneself be deceived or go astray. One must think that it is possible to grow, to develop one’s mind, to better oneself, and to persevere in this aim, even when it seems difficult.

You understand, Theo, what I mean by this? I am glad that I have not altogether lost my hope. I do not want to give up entirely, even though the situation is difficult.

There are so many things that I want to say, but I do not want to be too verbose. If only I had more clarity and peace of mind! But I am trying, as you advised, to cultivate patience and calmness in myself. The study of the miners’ work, as I have said, gives me much food for thought.

So now I conclude by wishing you well and sending you my regards. Write to me soon, if you can, for I often feel the need of a word from you.

Yours affectionately,<br>
`Vincent`

*Now I keep filling up my cup,*<br>
*until it spills over.*<br>

*Before,*<br>
*I kept buying bigger cups.*<br>

*It's made all the difference.*<br>

*Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud<br>
Turn forth her silver lining on the night?<br>
I did not err; there does a sable cloud<br>
Turn forth her silver lining on the night,<br>
And casts a gleam over this tufted grove.<br>*
